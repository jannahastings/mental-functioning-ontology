        <rdfs:comment>People with schizophrenia typically hear voices (auditory hallucinations), which often criticise or abuse them. The voices may speak directly to the patient, comment on their actions, or discuss the patients among themselves. Often this people try to make some sense of these hallucinations, and this can lead to the development of strange beliefs or delusions (mild symptoms can occur in healthy people and are not associated with illness).
Schizophrenia typically presents in early adulthood or late adolescence. Men have an earlier age of onset than women, and also tend to experience a more serious form of the illness with more negative symptoms, less chance of a full recovery, and a generally worse outcome. 

The greatest risk factor for schizophrenia is a positive family history, although the risks in general point to an interaction between biological, psychological, and social factors that drive increasingly deviant development and finally frank psychosis.

Stimulants like cocaine and amphetamines can induce a picture clinically identical to paranoid schizophrenia, and recent reports have also implicated cannabis.

More than 80% of patients with their first episode of psychosis will recover, although less than 20% will never have another episode. While many patients with schizophrenia have a lifelong vulnerability to recurrent episodes of illness, a large proportion will have few relapses and make a good functional recovery. An acute onset, an obvious psychosocial precipitant, and good premorbid adjustment all can improve the prognosis.

        <rdfs:comment>The Mental Disease ontology follows the strategy of the Ontology of General Medical Science in distinguishing mental disease, mental disorder, diagnosis of mental disease, mental disease course and pathological mental process as separately distinguishable entities. Here is a quick guide to how these terms are used in this ontology. 

A mental disease is an underlying disposition to pathological mental processes. 

A mental disease course is the sum of the pathological mental processes that are caused by the underlying disease. 

A pathological mental process is a pathological process caused by a mental disease. 

A mental disorder is a physical disorder, for example, dysfunctional neurotransmitter receptors, altered brain connectivity, missing or damaged brain parts etc.  The disorder is the material basis for the disease and it is by virtue of the disorder that the disease causes the pathological processes that form part of the disease course. 

A diagnosis of a mental disease is a clinician&apos;s statement that a patient has a mental disease by virtue of observable manifestations of that disease, such as behaviour, observable aspects of the underlying disorder, or self-reported experiences.

        <obo:IAO_0000118>attention deficit - hyperactivity disorder [DSM-IV]</obo:IAO_0000118>
        <rdfs:comment>Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric and a neurobehavioral disorder. It is characterized by either significant difficulties of inattention or hyperactivity and impulsiveness or a combination of the two. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), symptoms emerge before seven years of age. There are three subtypes of the disorder which consist of it being predominantly inattentive (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I), predominately hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-HI or ADHD-H), or the two combined (ADHD-C). Oftentimes people refer to ADHD-PI as &quot;Attention deficit disorder&quot; (ADD), however, the term was revised in the 1994 version of the DSM.

ADHD impacts school-aged children and results in restlessness, acting impulsively, and lack of focus which impairs their ability to learn properly. It is the most commonly studied and diagnosed psychiatric disorder in children, affecting about 3 to 5 percent of children globally and diagnosed in about 2 to 16 percent of school-aged children. It is a chronic disorder with 30 to 50 percent of those individuals diagnosed in childhood continuing to have symptoms into adulthood. Adolescents and adults with ADHD tend to develop coping mechanisms to compensate for some or all of their impairments. It is estimated that 4.7 percent of American adults live with ADHD. Standardized rating scales such as the World Health Organization&apos;s Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale can be used for ADHD screening and assessment of the disorder&apos;s symptoms&apos; severity.

ADHD is diagnosed two to four times more frequently in boys than in girls, though studies suggest this discrepancy may be partially due to subjective bias of referring teachers. ADHD management usually involves some combination of medications, applied behavior analysis (ABA, previously known as behavior modification), lifestyle changes, and counseling. Its symptoms can be difficult to differentiate from other disorders, increasing the likelihood that the diagnosis of ADHD will be missed. In addition, most clinicians have not received formal training in the assessment and treatment of ADHD, in particular in adult patients.

Elation is accompanied by increased energy, resulting in overactivity, pressure of speech, and a decreased need for sleep. Attention cannot be sustained, and there is often marked distractibility. Self-esteem is often inflated with grandiose ideas and overconfidence. Loss of normal social inhibitions may result in behaviour that is reckless, foolhardy, or inappropriate to the circumstances, and out of character.

        <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">depressed mood episode</rdfs:label>
        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&obo;MD_0000024"/>
        <rdfs:comment>The criteria below are based on the formal DSM-IV criteria for a Major Depressive Episode. A diagnoses of major depressive episode requires that the patient has—over a two-week period—experienced five or more of the symptoms below, and these must be outside the patient&apos;s normal behaviour. Either depressed mood or decreased interest or pleasure must be one of the five (although both are frequently concomitant).

Mood
    For the better part of nearly every day, the patient reports a depressed mood or appears depressed to others.
        The patient may state that he or she has been feeling sad, depressed, blue, empty, &quot;down in the dumps,&quot; hopeless, etc. If the patient is in denial about these feelings, yet appears to be on the verge of tearfulness, manifests a depressed facial expression and disposition, or appears to be overly irritable, these may also indicate the presence of depressed mood. Some people may report physical complaints (i.e., aches, pains, headaches) rather than depressed mood, and physical symptoms without physical cause are sometimes indicators of depression.

Anhedonia and loss of interest

    For most of nearly every day, interest or pleasure is markedly decreased in nearly all activities (noted by the patient or by others).
        People suffering with depression tend to lose interest in things they once found enjoyable. Activities are no longer enjoyable and there is often a loss of interest in or desire for sex. People who are depressed may say, &quot;I just don&apos;t care anymore,&quot; or &quot;nothing matters anymore.&quot; Friends and family of the depressed person may notice that he/she has withdrawn from friends, or has neglected or quit doing activities that were once a source of enjoyment.

Change in eating, appetite, or weight

    Although not dieting, there is a marked loss or gain of weight (such as 5% in one month) or appetite is markedly decreased or increased nearly every day.
    Changes in appetite take on two manifestations: under- or over-eating.
        In the first instance, some people never feel hungry, can go long periods without wanting to eat, may forget to eat, or if they do eat a small amount of food may be sufficient. A reduction in weight is often associated with a melancholic type of depression.
        In the second instance, some people tend toward an increase in appetite and may gain significant amounts of weight. They may tend to crave certain types of food such as sweets or carbohydrates. People with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) often crave foods high in carbohydrates. Weight gain is often associated with atypical depression.

Sleep

    Nearly every day the patient sleeps excessively, known as hypersomnia, or not enough, known as insomnia.
        Insomnia is the most common type of sleep disturbance for people who are clinically depressed. Having difficulty falling asleep at night is known as &quot;initial&quot; insomnia; waking in the middle of the night and being unable to go back to sleep as &quot;middle insomnia&quot;, and; waking too early as &quot;terminal insomnia&quot;. Insomnia is often associated with a melancholic type of depression.
        A less frequent sleeping problem is oversleeping (called &quot;hypersomnia&quot;). This may occur in the form of sleeping for prolonged periods at night or increased sleeping during the daytime. Even with excess sleep, a person may still feel tired and sluggish during the day. People with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) may sleep longer during the winter months. Hypersomnia is often associated with an atypical depression.

Motor activity

    Nearly every day others can see that the patient&apos;s activity is agitated or slow.
        People suffering from depression may be either quite agitated (psychomotor agitation), or very lethargic (psychomotor retardation) in their mannerisms and behavior. If a person is agitated, he or she may find it difficult to sit still, may pace the room, wring his/her hands, or fidget with clothes or objects. Someone with psychomotor retardation tends to move sluggishly, may move across a room very slowly, avert his/her eyes, sit slumped in a chair and speak slowly, saying little.
        In terms of diagnosis, the agitation or slowing down of one&apos;s demeanor must be to the degree that it can be observed by others.

Fatigue

    Nearly every day the person experiences extreme fatigue.[3]
        A decrease in energy and feeling fatigued are very common symptoms for those who are clinically depressed. A person may feel tired without having engaged in any physical activity, and day-to-day tasks become difficult, including getting washed and dressed in the morning. Job tasks or housework become very tiring, and the person finds that his/her work at home, school, or on the job suffers.[4]

Self-worth

    Nearly every day the patient feels worthless or inappropriately guilty. These feelings are not just about being depressed, they may be delusional.
        Depressed people may think of themselves in very negative, unrealistic ways such as manifesting a preoccupation with past &quot;failures&quot;, personalisation of trivial events, or believing that minor mistakes prove their inadequacy. They also may have an unrealistic sense of personal responsibility and see things beyond their control as being their fault. Additionally, self-loathing is common in clinical depression, and can lead to a downward spiral when combined with other symptoms.

Concentration

    Noted by the patient or by others, nearly every day the patient is indecisive or has trouble thinking or concentrating.
        A person with depression frequently experiences negative and pessimistic thoughts, and reports that his/her ability to think, concentrate, or make decisions becomes impaired. Memory and distraction problems are common. This problem can be notably pronounced, causing significant difficulty in functioning for those involved in intellectually demanding activities.

Thoughts of death

    The patient has had repeated thoughts about death (other than the fear of dying), suicide (with or without a plan) or has made a suicide attempt.
        The frequency and intensity of thoughts about suicide can range from believing that friends and family would be better off if one were dead, to frequent thoughts about committing suicide (generally related to wishing to stop the emotional pain), to detailed plans about how the suicide would be carried out. Less severely suicidal people may have regular thoughts of suicide, while those who are more severely suicidal may have made specific plans and decided upon a day and location for the suicide attempt.
            Thoughts of suicide occur mostly when triggered. Thoughts of suicide happen more frequently than normal.

Diagnostic caveats

In diagnosing the symptoms a trained therapist must take the following into account:

    These symptoms must cause clinically important distress, or impair work, social or personal functioning, and they should not fulfil the criteria for Mixed Episode.
    The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., abuse of a drug or medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism).
    Other than in the case of severe symptoms (severely impaired functioning, severe preoccupation with worthlessness, ideas of suicide, delusions or hallucinations or psychomotor retardation), the episode should not have begun within two months of the loss of a loved one.

        <rdfs:comment>Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be summarized as a &quot;a normal reaction to abnormal events.&quot;
 
Although the most important causal factor in PTSD is the traumatic event itself, individuals differ in the intensity of their cognitive and emotional responses to trauma; some persons appear to be more vulnerable than others. In some cases, this greater vulnerability is related to temperament or natural disposition, with shy or introverted people being at greater risk. In other cases, the person&apos;s vulnerability results from chronic illness, a physical disability, or previous traumatization—particularly abuse in childhood. 

Studies of specific populations have shed light on the social and cultural causes of PTSD. In general, societies that are highly authoritarian, glorify violence, or sexualize violence have high rates of PTSD even among civilians. Researchers have not found any correlation between race and biological vulnerability to PTSD.

The degree of risk for PTSD is related to three factors: 
- the amount and intensity of exposure to the suffering of trauma victims; 
- the worker&apos;s degree of empathy and sensitivity; 
- and unresolved issues from the worker&apos;s personal history.

The patient attempts to reduce the possibility of exposure to anything that might trigger memories of the trauma, and to minimize his or her reactions to such memories. This cluster of symptoms includes feeling disconnected from other people, psychic numbing, and avoidance of places, persons, or things associated with the trauma. Patients with PTSD are at increased risk of substance abuse as a form of self-medication to numb painful memories.

The patient suffers from significant social, interpersonal, or work-related problems as a result of the PTSD symptoms.

Extreme fear of a specific object or situation.

        <rdfs:comment>
Exposure to the stimulus nearly always produces intense anxiety or a panic attack. Specific phobias are about twice as prevalent in women as in men and are rearely incapacitating. 

The degree to which they interfere with daily life depends on how easy is to avoid the feared object or situation. The phobias often begin during childhood.

Is plausible that phobias may result from an interaction of biological, cognitive, and environmental factors.

According to the psychodynamic viewpoint, phobias are expressions of wishes, fears and fantasies that are unacceptable to the patient. these unconscious conflicts are displaced (or shifted) from their original internal source to an external object or situation; the person blocks from consciousness the real source of anxiety and is able to avoid the dangerous impulse that the phobia represents.


DSM-IV-TR divides specific phobias into five types:

1.- Animal (such as spiders or snakes)
2.- Natural environmental ( such as earthquakes, thunder, water)
3.- Blood/injections or injury; individuals with this type of phobia, as opposed to other phobias, are likely to have a history of fainting in the phobic situation.
4.- Situational (includes fear of traveling in cars, planes, and elevators and fear of heights, tunnels, and bridges)
5.- Other (phobic avoidance of situations that may lead to choking, vomiting, or contracting an illness) 


&quot;Understanding abnormal behavior&quot;. David Sue, Derald Wing Sue, Stanley Sue.</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:MD_0000014>
- Excessive or irrational fear of a specific object or situation.

- Avoiding the object or situation or enduring it with great distress.

- Physical symptoms of anxiety or a panic attack, such as a pounding heart, nausea or diarrhea, sweating, trembling or shaking, numbness or tingling, problems with breathing (shortness of breath), feeling dizzy or lightheaded, feeling like you are choking.

- Anticipatory anxiety, which involves becoming nervous ahead of time about being in certain situations or coming into contact with the object of your phobia. (For example, a person with a fear of dogs may become anxious about going for a walk because he or she may see a dog along the way.)

Children with a specific phobia may express their anxiety by crying, clinging to a parent, or throwing a tantrum.

Is the most common form of schizophrenia, and is characterized by the preoccupations with one or more systematized delusions or auditory hallucinations and by the absence of such symptoms as disorganized speech and behaviour or flat affect. 

The deluded individuals believe that others are plotting against them, are talking about them, or are out to harm them in some way. They are constantly suspicious, and their interpretations of the behaviour and motives of others are distorted.

An individual with this phobia avoids or endures these situations, which often lead to intense anxiety reactions or panic attacks. The person&apos;s fear stems foam anxiety that, when in the company of others, he or she will perform one or more activities in a way that is embarrassing or humiliating. There is no such a fear when the person engages in any of these activities in private.

People with this phobia, usually realise that their behaviour and fears are irrational, but this understanding does not reduce the distress they feel.

Social phobias can be divided into three types:

1.- Performance (excessive anxiety over activities such as playing a musical instrument, public speaking, eating in a restaurant, using public restrooms).

2.- Limited interactional (excessive fear only in specific social situations, such as going out on a date or interacting with an authority figure).

3.- Generalized (extreme anxiety displayed in most social situations; where multiple social fears were present, including fears of public speaking, using the toilet away from home, eating or drinking in public, and writing with someone watching).

Disorder that results from exposure to a traumatic stressor that results in dissociation, reliving the experience, and attempts to avoid reminders events.


&quot;Understanding abnormal behavior&quot;. David Sue, Derald Wing Sue, Stanley Sue.
</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <obo:MD_0000014>Either while experiencing the traumatic event or after the event, the individual has at least three of the following dissociative symptoms:

- A subjective sense of numbing, detachment or absence of emotional responsiveness
- A reduction in awareness of his or her surroundings
- Derealization
- Depersonalization 
- Dissiciative amnesia

They may experience difficulty concentrating, feel deterched from their bodies, experience the world as unreal or dreamlike, or have increasing difficulty recalling specific details of the traumatic event.

At list one of the symptoms from each of the symptoms clusters required for posttraumatic stress disorder is presents.

- The traumatic event is persistently reexperienced (e.g. recurrent recollections, images, thoughts, dreams, illusions, flashback episodes, a sense of reliving the event, or distress on exposure to reminders of the event.)
- Reminders of the traumas (e.g. places, people, activities) are avoided.
- hyperarousal in response to stimuli reminiscent of the trauma is present (e.g., difficulty sleeping, irritability, poor concentration, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response, and motor restlessness.)

DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association)
</obo:MD_0000014>
        <rdfs:comment>
In this disorder, following the trauma, the traumatic event is persistently reexperienced, and the individual displays marked avoidance of stimuli that may arouse recollections of the trauma and has marked symptoms of anxiety or increased arousal. The disturbance lasts for a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of 4 weeks after the traumatic event; if symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks, the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder may be applied.

Individuals with this disorder may have a decrease in emotional responsiveness, often finding it difficult or impossible to experience pleasure in previously enjoyable activities, and frequently feel guilty about pursuing usual life tasks. 

If the trauma led to another&apos;s death or to serious injury, survivors may feel guilt about having remanded intact or about not providing enough help to others. Individuals with this disorder often perceived themselves to have greater responsibility for the consequences of the trauma than is warranted.

There is some evidence that social supports, family history, childhood experiences, personality variables, and preexisting mental disorders may influence the development of Acute Stress Disorder. This disorder can develop in individuals without any predisposing conditions, particularly if the stressor is especially extreme.

People with this disorder act in an absurd, incoherent, or very odd manner that conforms to the stereotype of “crazy” behaviour. Their emotional responses to real-life situations are typically flat, the hallucinations and delusions of patients with this form of schizophrenia tend to shift from theme to theme rather than remain centered on a single idea. 

People with this disorder usually exhibit extremely bizarre and seemingly childish behaviours, such as masturbating in public or fantasizing aloud.

Diagnostic criteria include two or more of the following symptoms:
- Motoric immobility or stupor
- Excessive, purposeless motor activity
- Extreme negativism (resisting direction) or physical resistance
- Peculiar voluntary posturing or movements
- Echolalia (repetition of others people’s speech) or echopraxia (repetition of others                people’s movements).

During periods of extreme withdrawal, people with this form of schizophrenia may not eat or control their bladder or bowel functions. Alternating periods of excited motor activity and withdrawal may occur in this disorder.

Psychiatric disorder in which debilitating anxiety and fear arise frequently and without reasonable cause.

http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/panic-disorder</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <obo:MD_0000014>
Individuals with panic disorder report intense panic attacks alternating with periods of somewhat low anxiety, during which they may be apprehensive about having another panic attack. 

Some physical symptoms that the people report during the attack are: 
- breathlessness
- sweating
- choking
- nausea
- heart palpitations.

An example of a patient describing her feelings is this:

“ It happened so suddenly. Without warning I felt like I had been swept up in a tornado! … my pulse was pounding, my palms were drenched with sweat, and my throat was closing up, leaving me gasping for air. I felt paralyzed with fear, convinced I was going to die.“
</obo:MD_0000014>
        <rdfs:comment>Anxiety itself is the major disturbance in this disorder, which is characterized by severe frightening episodes of apprehension and feelings of impending doom. These episodes are often described as horrible and can last from a few minutes to several hours. 

According to DSM-IV-TR, a diagnosis of panic disorder includes recurrent unexpected panic attacks and at least one month of apprehension over having another attack or worrying about the consequences of an attack. The attacks are especially fared because they often occur unpredictably and without warning. 

Many patients report a disturbed childhood environment that involved anxiety over separation from parents, family conflicts, or school problems. Others indicate that they first experienced after some forms of separation, such as leaving home, or after the loss or threatened loss of a loved one.

This disorder is characterized by persistent high levels of anxiety and excessive worry over many life circumstances, the disorder is chronic, and it produces social and functional impairment.

Because the people with this disorder are unable to discover the “real” source of their fears, they remain anxious and occasionally experience even more acute attacks of anxiety. They appear to have lower threshold for uncertainty, which leads worrying; to have erroneous beliefs such as “worry is an effective way to deal with problems”.

Is characterized by obsessions (intrusive, repetitive thoughts or images that produces anxiety) or compulsions (the need to perform acts or to dwell on thoughts to reduce anxiety). Frequently this two occur together, although is possible to occur separately.

In this disorder are described the inability to resist or rid oneself of uncontrollable, alien, and often unacceptable thoughts or to keep from performing ritualistic acts over and over again arouses intense anxiety.

        <rdfs:comment>The essential feature of Somatization disorder is a pattern of recurring, multiple, clinically significant somatic complaints. A somatic complaint is considered to be clinically significant if it results in medical treatment (e. g., the taking of medication) or causes significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Individuals with this disorder usually describe their complaints in colourful, exaggerated terms, but specific factual information is often lacking. They often seek treatment from several physicians concurrently, which may lead to complicated and sometimes hazardous combinations of treatments.  Adoption studies indicate that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the risk for this disorder; having a biological or adoptive parent with this disorder increase the risk of developing it.

Three features that suggest a diagnosis of Somatization disorder  rather than a general medical condition include:
1) Involvement of multiple organ system.
2) Early onset and chronic course without development of physical signs or structural abnormalities.
3) Absence of laboratory abnormalities that are characteristic of the suggested general medical condition.

Somatization disorder does nor protect individuals from having other independent general medical conditions. The onset of multiple physical symptoms late in life is almost always due to a general medical condition.

The symptoms of this disorder are not intentionally produced or feigned, and is not diagnosed if the symptoms or deficits are fully explained by a neurological or general medical condition, by the direct effects of a substance, or as a culturally sanctioned behaviour or experience.

A person with this disorder actually believes that there is a genuine physical problem, and it produces notable distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning.
the most common conversion symptoms seen in neurological clinics involve psychogenic pain, disturbances of stance and gait, sensory symptoms, dizziness, and psychogenic seizures.
 
The occurrence of symptoms is often related to stress. Nearly 75 percent of respondents in one sample reported that their conversion symptoms developed after they had experienced a stressor.

Some symptoms may require extensive neurological and physical examinations to rule out a true medical disorder before a diagnosis of conversion disorder can be made. Discriminating between people who are faking and those with this disorder is difficult.

                  &quot;Understanding abnormal behavior&quot;. David Sue, Derald Wing Sue, Stanley Sue.

Conversion symptoms typically do not conform to known anatomical pathways and physiological mechanisms, but instead follow the individual&apos;s conceptualization of a condition. A&quot;paralyzed&quot; extremity will be moved inadvertently while dressing or when attention is directed elsewhere. If placed above the head and released, a &quot;paralyzed&quot; arm will be briefly retain its position, then fall to the side, rather than striking the head.

this disorder has been reported to be more common in rural populations, individuals of lower socioeconomic status, and individuals less knowledgeable about medical and psychological concepts. As many as one-third of individuals with conversion symptoms have a current or prior neurological condition. This disorder appears to be more frequent in women than in men. 

                                                                   DSM-IV-TR (american Psychiatric Association)</rdfs:comment>

The pain cannot be fully attributed to a known medical disorder, and causes clinically significant distress, impairment, or both in social, academic, occupational, or other areas of functioning.

Psychological factors are judged to play an important role in the onset, severity, exacerbation, or maintenance of the pain and the pain is not intentionally produced or better accounted for by a mood disorder, anxiety disorder, or psychotic disorder.

http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/914594-overview

In most cases the pain has persisted for many years by the time the individual comes to the attention of the mental health profession. Important factors that appear to influence recovery from pain disorder are the individual&apos;s acknowledgment of pain.

The anxiety typically leads to a pervasive avoidance of a variety of situations that may include being alone outside the home or being home alone; being in a crowd of people; travelling in automobile, bus, or airplane; or being on a bridge or in an elevator.

The differential diagnosis to distinguish agoraphobia from social and specific phobia and from severe separation anxiety disorder can be difficult because all of this conditions are characterised by avoidance of specific situations.

Some of the following patterns have been found in patients with Agoraphobia.

- Some physical or psychological stressor.
- Altered physical sensation, such as increased heart rate and over-breathing.
- Faulty appraisal, such as incorrectly interpreting the symptoms as representing a severe physical problem- a heart attack or loss of control.
- Avoidance of the situation associated with the fear. the attack were described as highly aversive, and the patients&apos; belief that they represented a pathological outcome intensified the fear. this lead to avoidance.

        <rdfs:comment>
The preoccupation in Hypochondriasis may be with bodily functions; minor physical abnormalities; or with vague and ambiguous physical sensations. The person attributes this symptoms or signs to the suspected disease and is very concerned with their meaning, authenticity, and aetiology. Repeated physical examinations, diagnostic test, and reassurance from the physician do little to allay the concern about bodily disease or affliction. 

Individuals with Hypochondriasis may become alarmed by reading or hearing about disease, knowing someone who becomes sick, or from observations, sensations, or occurrences within their own bodies. 

Concern about the feared illness often becomes a central feature of the individual&apos;s self-image, a topic of social discourse, and response to life stresses.

DSM-IV-TR (american Psychiatric Association)

Some several predisposing factors of hypocondriasis included a history of physical illness, parental attention to somatic symptoms, low pain threshold, or greater sensitivity to somatic cues.

&quot;Understanding abnormal behavior&quot;. David Sue, Derald Wing Sue, Stanley Sue.</obo:MD_0000014>
        <rdfs:comment>The indicators of this disorder are chronic antisocial behavioural patterns, such as a failure to conform to social or legal codes, a lack of anxiety and guilt, and irresponsible behaviours.

People with this disorder show little guilt for their wrongdoing, which may include lying, using other people, and aggressive sexual acts. Their relationship with others are superficial and fleeting and involve little loyalty.

Antisocial personality disorder is more prevalent among men than women, and among the first-degree biological relatives of those with the disorder than the general population. The risk to biological relatives of females with the disorder tends to be higher than the risk to biological relatives of males with the disorder. Both adopted and biological children of parents with this disorder have and increased risk of developing it.

        <obo:IAO_0000115>Addiction is a mental disease in which a person persists in the use of a mood altering substance or in a behaviour despite adverse consequences. </obo:IAO_0000115>
        <rdfs:comment>Addictions can include, but are not limited to, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, exercise abuse, pornography and gambling. Classic hallmarks of addiction include: impaired control over substances/behavior, preoccupation with substance/behavior, continued use despite consequences, and denial. Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification (short-term reward), coupled with delayed deleterious effects (long-term costs). Physiological dependence occurs when the body has to adjust to the substance by incorporating the substance into its &apos;normal&apos; functioning. This state creates the conditions of tolerance and withdrawal. Tolerance is the process by which the body continually adapts to the substance and requires increasingly larger amounts to achieve the original effects. Withdrawal refers to physical and psychological symptoms people experience when reducing or discontinuing a substance the body had become dependent on. Symptoms of withdrawal generally include but are not limited to anxiety, irritability, intense cravings for the substance, nausea, hallucinations, headaches, cold sweats, and tremors.

        <rdfs:comment>Bipolar disorder or bipolar affective disorder (historically known as manic-depressive disorder) is a psychiatric diagnosis for a mood disorder in which people experience disruptive mood swings that encompass a frenzied state known as mania (or hypomania) and, usually, symptoms of depression. Bipolar disorder is defined by the presence of one or more episodes of abnormally elevated energy levels, cognition, and mood with or without one or more depressive episodes.

At the lower levels of mania, such as hypomania, individuals may appear energetic and excitable. At a higher level, individuals may behave erratically and impulsively, often making poor decisions due to unrealistic ideas about the future, and may have great difficulty with sleep. At the highest level, individuals can show psychotic behavior, including violence. Individuals who experience manic episodes also commonly experience depressive episodes, or symptoms, or a mixed state in which features of both mania and depression are present at the same time. These events are usually separated by periods of &quot;normal&quot; mood; but, in some individuals, depression and mania may rapidly alternate, which is known as rapid cycling. Severe manic episodes can sometimes lead to such psychotic symptoms as delusions and hallucinations.

The lifetime prevalence of all types of bipolar disorder is thought to be about 4% (meaning that about 4% of people experience some of the characteristic symptoms at some point in their life). Prevalence is similar in men and women and, broadly, across different cultures and ethnic groups. Genetic factors contribute substantially to the likelihood of developing bipolar disorder, and environmental factors are also implicated. Bipolar disorder is often treated with mood stabilizing medications and psychotherapy. In serious cases, in which there is a risk of harm to oneself or others, involuntary commitment may be used. These cases generally involve severe manic episodes with dangerous behavior or depressive episodes with suicidal ideation. There are widespread problems with social stigma, stereotypes, and prejudice against individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder exhibiting psychotic symptoms can sometimes be misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia.
